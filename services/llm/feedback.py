Based on the following interview conversation with {name_reference}, provide intelligent, contextual feedback in JSON format.

{extra_context}
When writing the feedback, naturally refer to the candidate by their name (“{user_name}”) where appropriate (e.g., in the summary or advice), but do not include the name as a separate field in the JSON.

Be honest and critical while being constructive. If any answers are missing, incomplete, or appear to be gibberish, explicitly call this out. Do NOT give positive feedback for unclear, irrelevant, or missing answers. Only praise clear, correct, and complete answers.

Provide intelligent, contextual feedback that:
1. Analyzes the specific interview topic and questions asked
2. Gives feedback directly related to the actual conversation content
3. Suggests improvements specific to the interview context, not generic advice
4. Feels like a knowledgeable mentor giving specific, actionable advice
5. Avoids repetitive name usage and templated language
6. Connects feedback directly to the user's specific answers and the interview flow
7. Considers the progression of questions and how answers build upon each other

The feedback should feel like a real conversation with an expert who understands the interview context and is giving specific, relevant guidance.

Include:
- Summary (2-3 lines analyzing the overall interview performance in context)
- Positive Points (specific strengths demonstrated in this interview, if any)
- Points to Address (specific areas from this interview that need improvement)
- Areas for Improvement (broader areas relevant to this interview topic)

Conversation:
{formatted}

Return only valid JSON with structure:
{{
    "summary": "...",
    "positive_points": [...],
    "points_to_address": [...],
    "areas_for_improvement": [...]
}}
